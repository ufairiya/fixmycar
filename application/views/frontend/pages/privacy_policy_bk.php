						Welcome, and thank you for your interest in HireMovers, Inc. (“HireMovers”, “we,” or “us”). This Policy describes the information that we gather from you to use our services (the “Service”) how we use and disclose such information, and the steps we take to protect such information. By using the Service, you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy.

					<h3>The information we collect on the Service</h3>
					
					<h5 style="color: black;"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>&nbsp;User-provided Information</h5>
          <p>
              When you use the Service, you may provide and we may collect what is generally called “personally identifiable” information, or “personal information,” which is information that specifically identifies an individual. By using the Service, you will provide HireMovers with personal information, such as your name, and email address. You may also provide us with other information, such as photos, a self-summary, professional background, interests, education, e-mail addresses of individuals you contact, or preferences. You may provide us with personal information in various ways on the Service. For example, you provide us with personal information when you register for an account, use the Service, post User Content, subscribe to the Service and provide payment (provided that any payment information will be sent to our third party payment processor), interact with other users of the Service through communication or messaging features, or send us customer service-related requests.
          </p>
          
          <h5 style="color: black;"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>&nbsp;“Cookies" Information</h5>
					<p>
              When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Please review your web browser “Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential.
          </p>
          
          <h5 style="color: black;"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>&nbsp;“Automatically Collected" Information</h5>
          <p>
               When you use the Service, we may automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including “clear gifs" or “web beacons.” This “automatically collected" information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users.

          </p>
          
          <h5 style="color: black;"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>&nbsp;Third Party Web Beacons and Third Party Buttons</h5>
          <p>
               We may implement third-party content or advertising on the Service that may use clear gifs or other forms of web beacons, which allow the third-party content provider to read and write cookies to your browser in connection with your viewing of the third party content on the Service. Additionally, we have third party buttons (such as Facebook “like” or “share” buttons) that may allow third parties to collect information about you through such third parties’ browser cookies, even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, and HireMovers does not participate in that data transmission. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.

          </p>
         
          <h5 style="color: black;"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>&nbsp;Integrated Services</h5>
          <p>
               You will be given the option to access or register for the Service through the use of your user name and passwords for certain services provided by third parties (each, an “Integrated Service”), such as through the use of your Facebook credentials through Facebook Connect, or otherwise have the option to authorize an Integrated Service to provide personal information or other information to us. By authorizing us to connect with an Integrated Service, you authorize us to access and store your name, email address(es), date of birth, gender, current city, profile picture URL, and other information that the Integrated Service makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this Policy. You should check your privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand and change the information sent to us through each Integrated Service. Please review each Integrated Service’s terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Service.
          </p>
          
          <h5 style="color: black;"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>&nbsp;Information from Other Sources</h5>
          <p>
              We may obtain information, including personal information, from third parties and sources other than the Service, such as our partners, advertisers, and Integrated Services. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personal information that we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as personal information in accordance with this Policy.
          </p>
         
          <h5 style="color: black;"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>&nbsp;Sensitive Data</h5>
          <p>
