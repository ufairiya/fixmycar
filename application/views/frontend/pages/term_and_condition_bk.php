               Movers hereby agree to accurately disclose the full details of services listed.  Movers further agree that they are responsible for and agree to abide by all laws, rules, ordinances, or regulations applicable to the listing of their services, including but not limited to any and all laws, rules, ordinances, regulations or other requirements relating to taxes, credit cards, data and privacy, permits or license requirements, and safety compliance, as applicable.

</h5>
          <p>
               Each Mover is required to provide their own Terms and Conditions for their services.  Before payment, Customers are required to accept the Mover’s Terms and Conditions.  Once the Customer accepts and agrees to these terms, the Customer’s funds for the Mover’s services will be held in Escrow by HireMovers until the Customer agrees to release payment to the Mover. While we do take certain measures with the goal of assisting users to avoid potentially fraudulent or other illegal activity of which we become aware, we assume no liability or obligation to take any such measures or actions.
